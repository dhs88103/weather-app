# weather app

## Description

My motivation was to build a weather app that would allow the user to input their city into the search bar and receive a five day weather forecast.
I used an API to call the weather forecast to the app.
I learned about how to add that into my javascript pages.

## Usage

This app can be used to find the weather for the user's home city or whatever city they are looking for in the United States.
